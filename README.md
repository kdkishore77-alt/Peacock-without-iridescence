# Peacock-without-iridescence
Peacock-inspired photonic crystal simulations exploring how structural disorder suppresses iridescence and stabilizes structural color. This repository provides fully reproducible Python codes for optical response calculations, angle averaging, chromaticity stabilization, effective medium theory, and disorder–iridescence trade-off analysis.
